Any request except ("/auth/**, "/find/**") is not allowed without token, check SecurityConfiguration

public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf()
                .disable()
                .authorizeHttpRequests()
                .requestMatchers("/auth/**")


-> Add "/swagger-ui/**","/v3/api-docs/**" in securityfilter to by pass authentication for swagger
